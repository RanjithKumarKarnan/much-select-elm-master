<div id="multi-select-json-seperated-values">
  <h3>JSON Encoded Selected Values</h3>
  <p>
    In this example we've added the <code>selected-value-encoding="json"</code> attribute. This means that the <code>selected-value=</code> attribute is expected to be in JSON that has <em>also</em> been URI encoded with <code>encodeURIComponent()</code> (or something else that does the same job).
  </p>
  <p>In this case the selected value looks like <code>selected-value="%5B%22Hoki%22%2C%22Gibberfish%22%5D"</code></p>
  <p>Which is a URL Encoded JSON array that is just a list of strings.</p>
  <p>
    <code>
      ["Hoki","Gibberfish"]
    </code>
  </p>
  <much-select multi-select="true" selected-value="%5B%22Hoki%22%2C%22Gibberfish%22%5D" selected-value-encoding="json" allow-custom-options>
