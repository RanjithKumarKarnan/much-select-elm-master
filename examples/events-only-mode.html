<div id="events-only-mode">
  <h3>Events Only Mode</h3>
  <p>
    The <code>events-only=""</code> attribute is a little specialized, it
    is for when you are in a situation where something else <em>really</em>
    wants to have full control over the DOM. Elm would an example of this. In
    this case, we only want the <code>much-select</code> element to emmit events
    and leave it up to "something else" to managed its attributes.
